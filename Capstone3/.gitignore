# LlamaIndex Storage (rebuilt on deployment)

ragdocs/
# We might want to keep ragdocs in git if they are the source of truth,
# but usually large datasets are excluded.
# User instructions said "ragdocs/" contains PDFs.
# If they want to deploy to HF, they need the PDFs or the Index.
# Given "create vector database only one time", maybe we SHOULD keep ragdocs in git so HF can build it?
# Or maybe we should keep storage?
# "create vector database only one time for all documents."
# If I commit 'storage', HF won't rebuild it.
# If I commit 'ragdocs' and ignore 'storage', HF will build it once on startup (cached resource).
# I will ignore storage and keep ragdocs (assuming it's small enough for git, usually <100MB).
